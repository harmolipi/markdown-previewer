# Markdown Previewer

Created as part of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/markdown-previewer).

## Functionality

This is the [Markdown Previewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer) project, where I make a little web app that converts markdown (on the left) to HTML (on the right) live as you type.

## Thoughts

This ended up being a super easy project, and I chalk that up to React. Very cool to use. Also since I wasn't such a big fan of Bootstrap for the last one, I came back to Tailwind for this one.

God bless.
